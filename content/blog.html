        <div class="justify-paragraph"><p>I've lately started a personal project using tkinter and python. I've been discovering some of the advantages of open source and using a high-level language. It can allow for fast development time and some real results. I've been interested in writing my own applications since I started learning to work with technology. How I've been keeping busy. What I have now may really just be at alpha stage (unfinished). I'm still happy to be modeling today after studying Java frameworks and maybe some patterns. I've recently succeeded at integrating a tkinter framework into Windows. It plays well with jump lists and the timeline feature. It's starting to handle text files. If you right click any &quot;.txt&quot; file and open it with my editor it'll already interface with Windows. I think it may be light enough and still be capable of using some of the wider possibilities of python. This starting on a modest scale. I've named it <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ar_9mi3sZWIh30_RS8NLebuxL2JN?e=NxcD9P" target="_blank">Pypad</a> for now and you're welcome to try it if you like. You might get security warnings if you download new software from the internet. You can scan it with any anti-virus. It's very soon for me to know that it would give false positives. I don't think it would happen. It's merely a Unicode editor. It's currently trying to detect the character set of most text files as a best guess. I'll be trying to put time into it in the future. Even if only a demo of what I think can be achieved with python in Windows today.
